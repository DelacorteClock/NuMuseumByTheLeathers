# NuMuseum Application (Angular)

## Visit the Site

To enter the Angular NuMuseum application visit the site: delacorteclock.github.io/NuMuseumByTheLeathers

## Register

If you enter the site for the first time you will encounter the start page. Click the 'Register' button to open the registration modal. Then type your personal details. Follow the requirements (ie length and format) for a successful account creation. Save your password in a safe place and click 'DONE' when finished. An error may also occur if you try to create an account with a username which already exists. If the submission of your user info is successful you can click the button for 'Login'. Then follow the sign in instructions.

## Login

The start page is the default page which you will encounter if you go to delacorteclock.github.io/NuMuseumByTheLeathers without being logged in. Once you are in this page type your username and code to enter. It is essential to meet format and minimum length requirements before you can submit. If the login is successful you will get redirected to the collection page.

## Collection Exploration

You can explore the collection by clicking the 'Collection' button in the navigation bar. You will see a horizontally scrollable list of item cards. Each one includes a description, artist and department button. Each of these will open info about the item, an artist biography and museum department description in order mentioned. Click the favourite icon to add an item to your favourites.

## Profile Exploration

You can explore your profile page by clicking the 'Profile' button in the navigation bar. There you can view your personal details and access your favourites. You can remove a favourite by clicking the favourite icon.

## Profile Editing

Click 'Edit User' in the profile page if you need to edit your personal information. Use caution here and click 'Go Back' if you are there by mistake. If you are certain about your changes click 'Submit'.

## Logout

Click 'Logout' in the navigation bar to logout. If you do not do this you will stay logged in if your browser is still running (ie at least one tab still open).

## Deleting Your Accout

You can force delete your account in the profile editing page (accessible by clicking 'Edit User' in the profile page). Go to the bottom and click 'FORCE DELETE'. Then type the required text in the precise format required. Be very careful with this feature.

## Documentation

I used typedoc for documentation which is in the html file in the documentation folder.

## Description

This is an Angular app. It uses ts, scss and html. Typedoc was used for documentation. Angular material was used for key components. It is linked to the NuMuseum API linked to a MongoDB database which stores info about users and items.
